    {:reply, Map.get(worker_map, key), worker_map}
  end

  # This was my (incorrect) solution to how to create choose_worker. This works,
  # but is not idiomatic - since the worker_map is the state for this process,
  # we should be interacting with the state via call(). I'm leaving this here
  # for pedagogical purposes as an example of what NOT to do.
  # defp choose_worker(worker_map, key) do
  #   key = :erlang.phash2(key, 3)
  #   worker_map[key]

  def store(key, data) do
    # So this threading approach is the correct way:
    key
    |> choose_worker()
    |> Todo.DatabaseWorker.store(key, data)

    # This was the incorrect way. It's not wrong, it's just not idiomatic.
    # By not interacting with the process state correctly for choose_worker,
    # I kinda painted myself into the corner of using call and cast in
    # Database. Again, leaving this for pedagogical purposes:
    # GenServer.cast(__MODULE__, {:store, key, data})
  end

  def get(key) do
    key
    |> choose_worker()

    # See comments in store/2 above.
    # GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:get, key})

  #   Todo.DatabaseWorker.store(worker, key, data)
